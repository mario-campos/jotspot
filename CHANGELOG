  * Renamed the entire project from "plexlint" to "jotspot" to be in compliance with the Plex trademark policy (https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/plex-trademarks-and-guidelines/). For those curious, a "jot" is "the smallest bit" or an iota. So, to find tiny problems in large collections is to spot a jot ;)
  * Released v0.1.2

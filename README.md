# plexlint [![D](https://github.com/mario-campos/plexlint/actions/workflows/d.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mario-campos/plexlint/actions/workflows/d.yml)

plexlint is a command-line tool for scanning Plex library directories for potential problems. plexlint tries to identify files and directories that do not conform to Plexâ€™s recommended layout and naming conventions.

It couldn't be easier to use plexlint! Once compiled, simply supply one or more movie-library root directories with the `-m` flag.

```shell
$ plexlint -m /path/to/movies
PXLINT001  /path/to/movies/my_empty_folder
PXLINT002  /path/to/movies/movie.mkv
```

The output is be a tab-separated value of two "columns": the first contains the check ID&mdash;it's meaning can be referenced at the [homepage](https://mario-campos.github.io/software/plexlint/). The second column contains the problematic movie file/folder to which the check is referring.

## USAGE

```
plexlint -m|--movies PATH
plexlint -v|--version
plexlint -h|--help
```

## FLAGS

`-m`, `--movies`
* Specify a path to a movie library root directory. More than one of these flags can be passed.

`-V`, `--version`
* Output the version number.

`-h`, `--help`
* Output the usage and flags.

## BUILD

plexlint is written in the D programming language, which means you need [dub](https://dub.pm/) to compile plexlint:

```
dub build
```

## SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

* Linux
* FreeBSD

## CAVEATS

Currently, plexlint is limited to linting movies, but the goal is to eventually be able to lint TV shows and music as well.

# jotspot [![D](https://github.com/mario-campos/jotspot/actions/workflows/d.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mario-campos/jotspot/actions/workflows/d.yml)

jotspot is a command-line tool for scanning Plex library directories for potential problems. jotspot tries to identify files and directories that do not conform to Plexâ€™s recommended layout and naming conventions.

It couldn't be easier to use jotspot! Once compiled, simply supply one or more movie-library root directories with the `-m` flag.

```shell
$ jotspot -m /path/to/movies
jot001  /path/to/movies/my_empty_folder
jot002  /path/to/movies/movie.mkv
```

The output is be a tab-separated value of two "columns": the first contains the check ID&mdash;it's meaning can be referenced at the [homepage](https://mario-campos.github.io/software/jotspot/). The second column contains the problematic movie file/folder to which the check is referring.

## USAGE

```
jotspot -m|--movies PATH
jotspot -v|--version
jotspot -h|--help
```

## FLAGS

`-m`, `--movies`
* Specify a path to a movie library root directory. More than one of these flags can be passed.

`-V`, `--version`
* Output the version number.

`-h`, `--help`

## BUILD

jotspot is written in the D programming language, which means you need [dub](https://dub.pm/) to compile jotspot:

```
dub build

## SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

* Linux
* FreeBSD

## CAVEATS

Currently, jotspot is limited to linting movies, but the goal is to eventually be able to lint TV shows and music as well.
